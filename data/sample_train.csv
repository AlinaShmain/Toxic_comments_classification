Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge. If you truly desire to learn Taekkyeon there are only two masters in the world who know the complete system. One is in S. Korea, he doesn't teach many people. The other lives in Los Angeles, CA. The truth is, you have to either move to Los Angeles or S. Korea if you want to learn the Taekkyeon as taught by GM Song and Im Ho. 
I will tell you this. GM Song was a bodyguard of the remaining Choson Dynasty family memebers. The top Taekkyeon masters always defended the king, They were in the military. Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status. However, Taekkyeon is still a Holistic Martial art with many healing aspects and a civil game for children and adults. Its all three!

This is such a touching reference to genocide that I cannot let it pass.

If I remember rightly, Mel Gibson's """"Braveheart"""" did the same trick of mentioning this ethnic cleansing as a segue between scenes. It's just as morally reprehensible as the English doing this to the Scots, or Serbs doing this to Croats or...you get the idea.
