 Program Feature: To-Do ListThe Esperanza To-Do List is a place where you may list any request, big or small, for assistance. If you need help with archiving your usertalk, for example, all you need to do is list it here and somebody will help you out. Likewise, if you need help with some area of editing on Wikipedia, list it here! Again, any matter, trivial or not, can be placed on this page. However, all matters listed on this page must not be of an argumentative nature. You do not need to be a member of Esperanza (or this program) to place or fulfill requests on this page. If you don't have any requests, consider coming by and fulfilling a few!  This program has not been very active, but has lots of potential! What's New?In order to help proposed programs become specific enough to make into full-fledged programs, the In development section of the proposals page has been created.  Proposals that are promising, but need to be organized in more detail are listed here.  Please take a look at what is there, and help the proposals turn into programs.To improve both the layout and text of the front page, in an attempt to clarify the image of Esperanza, the front page is going to have some redesigning take place.  Please take your creative minds to Wikipedia:Esperanza/Front page redesign to brainstorm good ideas. Many thanks to , courtesy of , for delivering the newsletter.

 In order to make sure all users who join Esperanza are welcomed, a list of volunteers who are willing to welcome new Esperanzians is at Wikipedia:Esperanza/Members#Esperanza_welcomers.  Please add yourself if you are interested; we want to make sure all new Esperanza members are welcomed!
 The In development section of the proposals page has been created.
 Proposals page:  Some proposals have been moved to the aforementioned """"In development"""" section, some have been left as a proposal, and others have been archived.  For those proposals that were a good idea but didn't necessarily constitute a program, General Esperanzial Actions has been created.
 Two small pieces of charter reform will be decided on in a straw poll at Wikipedia talk:Esperanza/Governance.  One involves filling the position of any councillors who may leave, the other involves reforming the charter.
 Until cooperation with the Kindness Campaign is better defined, it remains as a proposed program.
 There is a page for discussing the front page redesign.

 Please apologize: you made a clear mistake. 

You are making a big mistake on Bitcoin: You removed my reliable source. THis is what you removed - including the reliable source - reliable as per Ladislav Mecir a very accomplised editor: Although bitcoin is not legally banned in terms of Russian law, it is in fact banned by the authorities on a de facto basis. On the other hand it is also true that there may be many millions of USD (it is a big economy) worth of bitcoins present today in Russia on computers owned by Russians since they bought them from and paid for them in Russian Roubles on exchanges accessible to them outside Russia - and that this practice most probably would continue with an equivalent increase in the number and value of bitcoins inside Russia.
Please revert your false allegations against me including that I am attacking other editors: I have a reliable source: you simply state: """"Please do not add or change content without citing a reliable source. Please review the guidelines at Wikipedia:Citing sources and take this opportunity to add references to the article.""""

 :::::No, your comparison is invalid. Your magnitude difference is just proportional to the difference of the realms we're talking about - editing a wiki knowledgebase vs. living. Saying you can log off from Wikipedia if you don't like Jimbo is like saying you can just kill yourself if you don't like living under your local dictator. It's saying you can give up on the entire thing if you don't like the conditions. If people don't have a better option, they will prefer suboptimal conditions to giving up entirely. That's why even people who despise Jimbo remain on Wikipedia, just as people in dictatorial countries don't kill themselves. However, in the latter case some will emigrate if they can, whereas there's no option to go to another Wikipedia equivalent because it's a natural monopoly. """"Love it or leave it"""" is an idiotic argument in the real world already, but even more so on Wikipedia. Criticizing Wikipedia's dictator is as legitimate as criticizing any other dictator. Since Jimbo is no longer paying anything for Wikipedia, he has no moral standing to claim eternal leadership. It's just an artifact of his role in the founding of Wikipedia which he has cleverly perpetuated. If this was a private company, it would be a different matter, but Jimbo himself is all the time presenting this as a cultural thing and as a self-governing community, playing down his own supremacy by not using any title like chairman or president, just calling himself """"founder"""".

 :::::::::I think that's fine. Are you going to make the changes or should I?  
 :::::::::Regarding judicial review, and the power to strike down legislation, I don't agree that those powers are not in the Constitution. Certainly, they are not specifically stated, but there are some implied powers in the text, in the sense that the text imposes duties and requirements on bodies which are only possible through the excercise of a power not explicitly granted. Thus, for example, Article I nowhere states that Congress can run a decennial census - but in order to meet the requirements of Art. I, §2, Cl. 3, Congress must hold a census. Likewise, the court is granted certain duties in Article III, and even if one assumes that judicial review is not inherently part of """"the judicial power"""", those powers and duties granted cannot be excercised absent the power to strike down laws. 
 :::::::::I should stress that I am not surrendering to The Living Constitution; there is a vast difference, in my view, between obviously and necessarily implied powers, and the atextual """"penumbras"""" of Justice Douglas (Griswold, Roe, etc.).  7 July 2005 20:33 (UTC)"""

150022,"Hi Horst. Nice to meet you. You're doing a great job, especially if English isn't your first language. I'd hate to be editing in anything other than English.

Signing is done when you are editing a 'talk' page. When you are having a discussion it really helps to know who said what, and when. We always encourage people to sign whatever they write there. However in articles everything is considered 'common property'. We don't sign what we write, because we don't want to think that we 'own' it in any way; someone might come along and change it later. Once an article has been in existence for more than a few days there are usually many people who have contributed to it. In some cases there may be nothing left of what the first author wrote.

What a lot of people do is put a list of articles that they have made big contributions to on their own user page. That gives you an idea of what a person has done here without claiming 'ownership'.

I hope you are finding out what you need to know. Feel free to ask lots of questions. Wikipedia:Village pump is useful if you can't find the answer anywhere else, or ask me or someone else. Enjoy your time here.  15:14, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)"

 ==Deletion== 

 Hi BigHairRef, 

 So you delete pages posted by smaller companies who are putting up information about their organization, ones that are written without trying to sell any product - but you leave big companies on wikipedia alone. I guess you can't fight the big companies and you prefer to bully small companies who don't have the guns to keep their information on the site. There have been stories in the main stream press about how corporations are using wikipedia for blatant marketing - and i just looked at a few of them and its amazing what they get away with compared to what I wrote about my company. 

 So, do you like to help the rich get richer rather than allow any company to put up information about their history, background, inventions, etc. I agree, using Wikipedia for marketing or to simply try to get traffic is wrong, but if big companies or well financed small companies can put their info up, then any company should be able to put up their history and information without being labeled """"blatant marketing"""". Who are you to say which company is or is not relevant to have their information on wikipedia? What are the criteria for one company to be here and another company to not be here - the rules are there, but they are not clear. 

 If a small company crosses the line, you should give them a chance to make edits and put their information up. I attempted to make edits, got no feedback, and tried to do everything i could to comply. And yet, my name is up as clear as day in this site as if I am a scoundrel just looking to abuse this great site. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I respect wikipedia, i use it regularly, and I don't like blatant marketing on this site as much as you do. 

 I don't want you flaming me again, so that's why you won't see my name - but this is really wrong. Also, I'm sure you will delete this immediately as you won't have this type of criticism on your page.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    """
